          <h1>What to Wear</h1>

<p>The Gaskell Ball is a formal Victorian Ball, and Victorian formalwear is the preferred standard of dress. 
Formalwear of more recent years is also totally acceptable.</p>
<p>You can check the photo at the top of the page
to get an idea of what is typically worn at the ball.</p>
<p>The December, 2024 ball is <em>not</em> a costume ball.</p>

<p>To preserve the look of the ball, casual attire, such as jeans and T-shirts, costumes, etc., will not be allowed.</p>
<p>No part of your attire that might be 
a hazard to other dancers is allowed.</p>
<p> Weapons are not allowed, not even if they are historically accurate parts of your attire.</p>
<p>If you haven't danced in what you will be wearing, we recommend testing this before the ball.</p>
<p>The committee reserves the right to turn away anyone not appropriately attired.</p>

<h2>Gentlemen's Attire</h2>

<p>Tuxedos, of any year, are the most commen attire for gentlemen. </p>
<p>Historical formal attire is also popular, such as Tailcoats or Cutaways.</p>
<p>Hstorical military <em>dress</em> uniforms are also worn. (no swords).</p>
<p>Modern dress uniforms are also welcome, if they are yours.</p>
<p>A modern suit is acceptable, and a jacket & tie (with slacks & a dress shirt) is the minimum level of dress.</p>
<p>While you do see men in photo above in just a vest, no jacket, 
they arrived in a jacket and tie. We make allowances for overheating while dancing.</p>

<h2>Ladies' Attire</h2>

<p>Ladies' attire may include ballgowns, evening gowns or any formal dress. Prom dresses and bridesmaids dress can work, too.</p>
<p>When choosing your attire for the evening, such things as non-removable trains, exposed hat pins, or costume pieces that may poke or annoy other dancers should be avoided.</p>
<p>It is also rather challenging to dance in a dress that brushes the floor so try to leave at least 4 inches clearance.
Hem appropriately or you may be stepping on it all night.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to know what shoes you will be wearing before you can set the hem.</p>

<h2>Shoes</h2>

<p>A ball is a great place to wear comfortable shoes. If you are wearing a long dress, no one will see your shoes, anyway. 
Some people wear ballet flats. If you wear shoes that are open on top, like a classic pump, you will want to 
get a style with a strap. The strap will keep if from flying off, during a fast dance.</p>
<p>Shoes designed for dancing are best, if you have them. Ballroom shoes labelled practice shoes are generally easier and more comfortable to dance in.
If you get suede bottom shoes, <em>do not</em> wear them outside. They are easy to damange. Wear other shoes and change inside the hall.</p>
<p>If you buy new shoes for the ball, we recommend dancing in them for a while, to break them in and see if there are issues, <em>before</em> the ball. Bringing spare shoes is also a good idea.</p>
<p>Shoes that can turn on a wooden floor are good. Most athletic shoes are not good, as they are designed to grip the floor. The really slick leather soled men's dress shoes aren't ideal, either, as they are too slippery.
Men's modern dress shoes, with a non-sticky rubber sole or plastic sole can work.</p>
<p>Avoid tall platforms or spike heels, they are a danger both to yourself, and those around you.<p>
